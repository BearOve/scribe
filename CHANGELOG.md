### 0.2.5

* Fixed target gap offset resolution introduced in v0.2.4, which did not handle
  all cases.

### 0.2.4

* Updated gap buffer to move gap to the end of the buffer before reallocating.
  This prevents a split/two-segment gap when inserting enough data at the start
  to trigger a reallocation.

### 0.2.3

* Drop empty operation groups when explicitly ended via end_operation_group or
  implicitly via undo.
